## normal vs applicative order evaluation

normal-order evalutation

First fully expand the operations. Only evaluate the operands when they are needed.

applicative-order evaluation

First evaluate the operands.

# recursion and iteration

A _recursive procedure_ (or function) is one that call itself.

A process is the whole of computational steps generated by a procedure.

A _recursive process_ is a process with _deferred_ computations.
Some operations can only be executed by first exucting others and so one.

A _iterative process_ is a process without deferred computations.
At each step the state of all variables is known.

In a recursive process the interpreter needs to remember extra information to be able to complete the process.
The longer the process is, the more information must be maintained.
This can cause problems (stack overflow in Java).

tail-recursive: This is a property of a programming language. A language with tail-recursion can execute iterative processes in constant space.
